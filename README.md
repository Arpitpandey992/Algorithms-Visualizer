## Running on Development Mode
To run the project on your local machine, open a terminal in the root directory and run 
* `npm install` (To install all dependencies)
* `npm start` (Starting the development server)

Needless to say, you will need node.js and npm with `npm` in `${PATH}` to run this in development mode.
